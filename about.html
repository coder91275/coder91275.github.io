     <p><img src="images.taiya/seablue1.jpg"/>KetaiyaAveria</p><p>Hello! Welcome to my site. My name is Ketaiya Averia, and I am a Professional Makeup Artist based in the New York City and Philadelphia areas. I specialize in makeup for brides, weddings, proms, and editorials. I have the ability to create either a natural, fresh & polished looks or giving you the pinache and glam you are looking for to stand out in a crowd - to learn more about my artist style (click here)

I have a unique background as I come from the corporate world. I learned valuable firsthand experience on how to run a business + market my services. I make it a point to build and maintain relationships with my bridal clients. Excellent customer service + creating a memorable experience is my promise when brides book my wedding day services.

As an artist, I love making women feel good about themselves. What’s unique about my approach is that I ask questions and listen first. I do this because my client’s personal vision, needs, and comfort are the utmost priority. I love getting to know my brides, and enjoy hearing any + all about their wedding details. I truly appreciate the hard work + dedication it takes to plan such a special event.

While my specialty and core business is weddings, I do offer services for any special event you want to look your best for. All my services are also on-location which means that I travel to you!</p>
